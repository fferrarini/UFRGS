@article{Foo2010,
abstract = {Since hydrogen is adsorbed much less than almost any other components, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is the most relevant approach to produce pure hydrogen; therefore, developing a strategy to design and model such a plant is attractive from the industrial view point. In this research, a practical approach is proposed to estimate the breakthrough time of a commercial PSA process using 5A molecular sieve. According to the experimental data of adsorption isotherms and kinetic rates of adsorption in porous media, the mathematical model of PSA plant is solved using Aspen adsorption software; then, the calculated breakthrough time for the hydrogen purification is compared with the industrial data. Results indicate that the estimated time is close to the actual value obtained from the industrial plant, and it can guarantee a safe operation without bridging the breakthrough point corresponding to hydrogen purification using 5A molecular sieve.},
