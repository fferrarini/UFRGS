@article{Foo2010,
abstract = {Since hydrogen is adsorbed much less than almost any other components, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is the most relevant approach to produce pure hydrogen; therefore, developing a strategy to design and model such a plant is attractive from the industrial view point. In this research, a practical approach is proposed to estimate the breakthrough time of a commercial PSA process using 5A molecular sieve. According to the experimental data of adsorption isotherms and kinetic rates of adsorption in porous media, the mathematical model of PSA plant is solved using Aspen adsorption software; then, the calculated breakthrough time for the hydrogen purification is compared with the industrial data. Results indicate that the estimated time is close to the actual value obtained from the industrial plant, and it can guarantee a safe operation without bridging the breakthrough point corresponding to hydrogen purification using 5A molecular sieve.},

@article{Khan1997,
abstract = {Aqueous solutions of phenol, p-chlorophenol, and p-nitrophenol have been used to determine the adsorption isotherm for single solute systems on activated carbon at different temperatures. The experimental program has been conducted to investigate the influence of concentration and temperature. All the reported equilibrium isotherm equations have been tried on present and published experimental data. A generalized isotherm equation which was proposed by Khan et al. (6, 10) and tested for bi-solute adsorption data has been modified for single-solute system. The temperature dependency has also been incorporated into a generalized equation. It has been noticed that the Radke and Prausnitz (7) and generalized isotherm equations could represent the entire data with a minimum average percentage error. The influence of different adsorbents, sorbate concentrations, and pH of aqueous solutions has also been discussed in detail. The temperature dependency has been investigated using both the Dubinin-Astakov (13) and the modified generalized equation. The generalized equation describes the experimental and published data adequately and provides a single value of differential molar heat of adsorption, DeltaHads, for a single solute adsorption system. The Dubinin-Astakov isotherm equation has shown an increasing trend of DeltaHads as the loading of adsorbent has increased. Copyright 1997 Academic Press. Copyright 1997Academic Press},
