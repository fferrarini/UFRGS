  abstract = {This work presents an empirical correction to improve the Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) for representing the densities of pure liquids and liquid mixtures in the saturated region using the volume translation method. A temperature-dependent volume correction is employed to improve the original PR EOS so that it can match the true critical point of pure fluids. The volume correction is generalized as a function of the critical parameters and the reduced temperature. The volume translation PR (VTPR) EOS with the generalized volume correction accurately represents the saturated liquid densities for different polar and non-polar fluids, including alkanes, cycloparaffins, halogenated hydrocarbons, olefins, cyclic olefins, aromatics and inorganic molecules. The average relative deviations for 91 pure compounds was 1.37%. The generalized VTPR EOS was also used to predict the saturated liquid density of 53 binary mixtures with a relative deviation of 0.98%. The generalized VTPR EOS can also be extended to other materials. The accuracy of the generalized VTPR EOS compares well with other methods and equations of state.},

  abstract = {Abstract: A mixing rule for cubic equations of state (CEoS) applicable to all types of system asymmetries-referred to hereafter as the universal mixing rule (UMR)-is proposed. For the cohesion parameter of the CEoS, the mixing rule involves the Staverman-Guggenheim part of the combinatorial term and the residual term of the original UNIFAC Gibbs free energy expression. For the covolume parameter of the CEoS, the quadratic concentration-dependent mixing rule is used with the combining rule for the cross parameter bij = [1/2(bi1/2   bj1/2)]2. This UMR is applied to the volume-translated and modified version of the Peng-Robinson equation of state of Magoulas and Tassios (Fluid Phase Equilib. 1990, 56, 119), leading to what is referred to as the UMR-PR model. Very satisfactory results are obtained using the existing interaction parameters of the original UNIFAC model for vapor-liquid equilibrium predictions at low and high pressures for a wide range of system asymmetries including mixtures containing polymers. Satisfactory liquid-liquid equilibrium predictions are also obtained with the UMR-PR model.},
