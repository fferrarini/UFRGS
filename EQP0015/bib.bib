Examples of the use of the equation for predicting the vapor pressure and volumetric behavior of singie-component systems, and the phase behavior and volu- metric behavior of binary, ternary, and multicomponent systems are given. The proposed equation combines simplicity and accuracy. It performs as well as or better than the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation in all cases tested and shows its greatest advantages in the prediction of liquid phase densities},

@article{Redlich1949,
abstract = {The calculation of fugacities from P-V-T data necessarily involves a differentiation with respect to the mole fraction. The fugacity rule of Lewis, which in effect would eliminate this differentiation, does not furnish a sufficient approximation. Algebraic representation of P-V-T data is desirable in view of the difficulty of numerical or graphical differentiation. An equation of state containing two individual coefficients is proposed which furnishes satisfactory results above the critical temperature for any pressure. The dependence of the coefficients on the composition of the gas is discussed. Relations and methods for the calculation of fugacities are derived which make full use of whatever data may be available. Abbreviated methods for moderate pressure are discussed.},

@article{Soave1972,
abstract = {A modified Redlich-Kwong equation of state is proposed. Vapor pressures of pure compounds can be closely reproduced by assuming the parameter a in the original equation to be temperature-dependent. With the introduction of the acentric factor as a third parameter, a generalized correlation for the modified parameter can be derived. It applies to all nonpolar compounds. With the application of the original generalized mixing rules, the proposed equation can be extended successfully to multicomponent-VLE calculations, for mixtures of nonpolar substances, with the exclusion of carbon dioxide. Less accurate results are obtained for hydrogen-containing mixtures. ?? 1972.},

@book{Jones2006,
abstract = {This reference work targets researchers who have chosen a career in this complex but essential industry as well as people who are new in the industry and are looking for easy references to the work in which they are involved. This Handbook is an essential addition to the libraries of universities which contain a chemical engineering faculty as well as to the libraries of engineering construction companies, and oil refineries. This Handbook describes and discusses the features that make up the petroleum refining industry. It begins with a description of the crude oils and their nature. It continues with the saleable products from the refining processes, with a review of the modern day environmental impact. There is a complete overview of the processes that make up the refinery with a brief history of the processes. It also describes design technique, operation, and, in the case of catalytic units, the chemistry of the reaction routes. These discussions are supported by calculation procedures and examples, sufficient to enable good input to modern computer simulation packages. The Handbook also covers off-sites and utilities, as well as environmental and safety aspects relevant to the industry. The chapter on refinery planning covers both operational planning and the decision making procedures for new or revamped processes. Finally, the major items of equipment used in the industry are reviewed. This chapter gives a detail of the equipment with examples of the process specifications for these items. The final chapter is in part a glossary and in part a dictionary of the terms and expressions used in Petroleum Refining. This part of the book also includes an appendix section with an item on much used data such as converging factors, selected crude oil assays and an example of optimising a refinery configuration using linear programming.},

abstract = {Models of two important characterisation procedures for oil and oil fractions, ASTM D86 (ASTM = American Society for Testing of Materials) and EFV (Equilibrium Flash Vaporization), were presented.

It was shown how to deal with a possible problem of higher index of differential-algebraic model of the ASTM D86. A number of examples proved the adequacy of the presented models.},
