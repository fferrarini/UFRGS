abstract = {The calculation of fugacities from P-V-T data necessarily involves a differentiation with respect to the mole fraction. The fugacity rule of Lewis, which in effect would eliminate this differentiation, does not furnish a sufficient approximation. Algebraic representation of P-V-T data is desirable in view of the difficulty of numerical or graphical differentiation. An equation of state containing two individual coefficients is proposed which furnishes satisfactory results above the critical temperature for any pressure. The dependence of the coefficients on the composition of the gas is discussed. Relations and methods for the calculation of fugacities are derived which make full use of whatever data may be available. Abbreviated methods for moderate pressure are discussed.},

abstract = {A modified Redlich-Kwong equation of state is proposed. Vapor pressures of pure compounds can be closely reproduced by assuming the parameter a in the original equation to be temperature-dependent. With the introduction of the acentric factor as a third parameter, a generalized correlation for the modified parameter can be derived. It applies to all nonpolar compounds. With the application of the original generalized mixing rules, the proposed equation can be extended successfully to multicomponent-VLE calculations, for mixtures of nonpolar substances, with the exclusion of carbon dioxide. Less accurate results are obtained for hydrogen-containing mixtures. ?? 1972.},

@book{Jones2006,
abstract = {This reference work targets researchers who have chosen a career in this complex but essential industry as well as people who are new in the industry and are looking for easy references to the work in which they are involved. This Handbook is an essential addition to the libraries of universities which contain a chemical engineering faculty as well as to the libraries of engineering construction companies, and oil refineries. This Handbook describes and discusses the features that make up the petroleum refining industry. It begins with a description of the crude oils and their nature. It continues with the saleable products from the refining processes, with a review of the modern day environmental impact. There is a complete overview of the processes that make up the refinery with a brief history of the processes. It also describes design technique, operation, and, in the case of catalytic units, the chemistry of the reaction routes. These discussions are supported by calculation procedures and examples, sufficient to enable good input to modern computer simulation packages. The Handbook also covers off-sites and utilities, as well as environmental and safety aspects relevant to the industry. The chapter on refinery planning covers both operational planning and the decision making procedures for new or revamped processes. Finally, the major items of equipment used in the industry are reviewed. This chapter gives a detail of the equipment with examples of the process specifications for these items. The final chapter is in part a glossary and in part a dictionary of the terms and expressions used in Petroleum Refining. This part of the book also includes an appendix section with an item on much used data such as converging factors, selected crude oil assays and an example of optimising a refinery configuration using linear programming.},

@article{Flory1951,
abstract = {A statistical mechanical treatment of high polymer solutions has been carried out on the basis of an idealized model, originally proposed by Meyer, which is analogous to the one ordinarily assumed in the derivation of the ``ideal{\&}apos;{\&}apos; solution laws for molecules of equal size. There is obtained for the entropy of mixing of nsolvent and N linear polymer molecules (originally disoriented), $\Delta$S=−k[(n/$\beta$) ln v 1 +N ln v 2 ] where v 1 and v 2 are volume fractions and $\beta$ is the number of solvent molecules replaceable by a freely orienting segment of the polymer chain. This expression is similar in form to the classical expression for equal‐sized molecules, mole fractions having been replaced by volume fractions. When the disparity between the sizes of the two components is great, this expression gives entropies differing widely from the classical values, which accounts for the large deviations of high polymer solutions from ``ideal{\&}apos;{\&}apos; behavior. The entropy of disorientation of a perfectly arranged linear polymer is found to be of the order of R cal. per chain segment. After introducing a suitable heat of mixing term, partial molal free energies are computed, and the calculations are compared with experimental data for all concentrations. Phase equilibria have been calculated in the region of partial miscibility. The theory predicts, in agreement with experiment, that the critical composition for partial miscibility lies at a low concentration of polymer. Low intrinsic viscosities of polymers dissolved in poor solvents are attributed to the tendency for the molecule to assume a more compact configuration in such an environment.},

abstract = {A statistical mechanical treatment of high polymer solutions has been carried out on the basis of an idealized model, originally proposed by Meyer, which is analogous to the one ordinarily assumed in the derivation of the ``ideal{\&}apos;{\&}apos; solution laws for molecules of equal size. There is obtained for the entropy of mixing of nsolvent and N linear polymer molecules (originally disoriented), $\Delta$S=−k[(n/$\beta$) ln v 1 +N ln v 2 ] where v 1 and v 2 are volume fractions and $\beta$ is the number of solvent molecules replaceable by a freely orienting segment of the polymer chain. This expression is similar in form to the classical expression for equal‐sized molecules, mole fractions having been replaced by volume fractions. When the disparity between the sizes of the two components is great, this expression gives entropies differing widely from the classical values, which accounts for the large deviations of high polymer solutions from ``ideal{\&}apos;{\&}apos; behavior. The entropy of disorientation of a perfectly arranged linear polymer is found to be of the order of R cal. per chain segment. After introducing a suitable heat of mixing term, partial molal free energies are computed, and the calculations are compared with experimental data for all concentrations. Phase equilibria have been calculated in the region of partial miscibility. The theory predicts, in agreement with experiment, that the critical composition for partial miscibility lies at a low concentration of polymer. Low intrinsic viscosities of polymers dissolved in poor solvents are attributed to the tendency for the molecule to assume a more compact configuration in such an environment.},

abstract = {Highlights: ???The F-SAC model is extended with a new temperature correction for hydrogen bonding systems.???The modified model is able accurately correlate the very small mutual solubilities of hydrocarbon-water systems.???The minimum solubility of hydrocarbons in water around room temperature is well represented. In this paper, the F-SAC model was extended in order to better represent the mutual solubility of hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes, alkenes, cycloalkenes and aromatics) in water. Aqueous mixtures of hydrocarbons exhibit an extremely non-ideal behavior, resulting in very low solubilities. A new parameter for the computation of the association energy was proposed, enabling a better agreement with temperature dependent experimental data in wide temperature ranges. Infinite-dilution activity coefficient as well as liquid-liquid equilibrium data were considered. The results were compared with some UNIFAC variants, found in the literature. For the studied systems, the proposed method performed better, including the quantitative representation of the experimentally observed minimum solubility point of hydrocarbons in the water-rich phase, while none of UNIFAC models tested were capable of predicting such behavior. Further, improved high-pressure results were obtained when the proposed model was coupled with a cubic equation of state through the SCMR mixing rule.},
