abstract = {The development of a new two-constant equation of state in which the attractive pressure term of the semiem- pirical van der Waals equation has been modified is outlined. Examples of the use of the equation for predicting the vapor pressure and volumetric behavior of singie-component systems, and the phase behavior and volu- metric behavior of binary, ternary, and multicomponent systems are given. The proposed equation combines simplicity and accuracy. It performs as well as or better than the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation in all cases tested and shows its greatest advantages in the prediction of liquid phase densities},

@article{Redlich1949,
abstract = {The calculation of fugacities from P-V-T data necessarily involves a differentiation with respect to the mole fraction. The fugacity rule of Lewis, which in effect would eliminate this differentiation, does not furnish a sufficient approximation. Algebraic representation of P-V-T data is desirable in view of the difficulty of numerical or graphical differentiation. An equation of state containing two individual coefficients is proposed which furnishes satisfactory results above the critical temperature for any pressure. The dependence of the coefficients on the composition of the gas is discussed. Relations and methods for the calculation of fugacities are derived which make full use of whatever data may be available. Abbreviated methods for moderate pressure are discussed.},

@article{Soave1972,
abstract = {A modified Redlich-Kwong equation of state is proposed. Vapor pressures of pure compounds can be closely reproduced by assuming the parameter a in the original equation to be temperature-dependent. With the introduction of the acentric factor as a third parameter, a generalized correlation for the modified parameter can be derived. It applies to all nonpolar compounds. With the application of the original generalized mixing rules, the proposed equation can be extended successfully to multicomponent-VLE calculations, for mixtures of nonpolar substances, with the exclusion of carbon dioxide. Less accurate results are obtained for hydrogen-containing mixtures. ?? 1972.},
